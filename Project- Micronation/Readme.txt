This project involves an ETL data manipulation workload to look at micronations. We take the data from multiple websites and scape them into pandas data frames. The data is then transformed into a common schema and some additional columns are added in to better make sense of the data. Lastly, the data is plotted in python and exported out to a excel, where it can be loaded into Power BI to make more advanced visualizations
